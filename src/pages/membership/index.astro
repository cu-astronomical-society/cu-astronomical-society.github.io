      <div class="membership-info">
        <p>In order to join CUAS please submit the membership form below. If you encounter any problems with this form, please contact the Membership Secretary. The current membership charges are:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Annual membership: £9</li>
          <li>Life membership: £15</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Joining gives you some great opportunities. All speaker meetings and ObsNights are free to members. We always try to offer discounted rates for most social events. Members of the University also have to join in order to gain access to the telescopes on their own. Life membership means life membership - even after graduation you can come to meetings!</p>
        
        <p>Membership is open to all members of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin Universities. Other potential members are asked to contact the <a href="/about/committee/">Membership Officer</a> for more details.</p>
