    <h1>Operating the Northumberland Telescope</h1>
    
    <p>The Northumberland telescope is a 12-inch refractor, with a 20 ft focal length (6096 mm, f/20). Built in 1838 from a design by George Airy, it was one of the largest telescopes of its time. It is mounted on an English equatorial mount.</p>

    <h2>Before Using the Telescope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the weather: Do not open the dome if it is raining</li>
        <li>Bring a red light torch to preserve night vision</li>
        <li>Remember that the telescope is unavailable on Wednesday evenings from October to March (used for Public Observing)</li>
        <li>Get the key from Churchill College Porters' Lodge using your ObsCard</li>
        <li>Know the alarm code for the Northumberland dome</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the dome and deactivate the alarm by entering the code</li>
        <li>Turn on the red lights (switches to the right of the door)</li>
        <li>Fill in the Attendance Book (your full name, number of observers, activity, telescope, arrival time)</li>
        <li>Ensure the telescope is unclamped at the base before moving it</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Important Warnings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Never point the telescope below the horizontal (roughly below the metal railing on the dome wall) as the lens is not secured and may fall out!</li>
        <li>Always move the telescope slowly</li>
        <li>Only move in right ascension (RA) by turning the main column, and only when clamps are unclamped and worm disengaged</li>
        <li>Move in declination (DEC) by grabbing the main telescope tube or brass knobs on either side of the focuser</li>
        <li>Do not move the telescope by holding the eyepiece, focuser, or finderscope</li>
        <li>Ensure the telescope does not crash into anything while moving it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Opening the Dome</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Point the telescope away from the slit to protect the lens from debris</li>
        <li>Unlock the dome by pulling the rope on the left of the slit with the metal latch locking it (pull the side with the weight attached)</li>
        <li>Open the slit using the pulley to the right of the slit</li>
        <li>Make sure the latch doesn't fall back and prevent opening</li>
        <li>Open the slit enough so that the edge has moved beyond the edge of the dome at the bottom</li>
        <li>To rotate the dome roof, use the pulley to the left of the rope with the latch</li>
        <li>Rotate slowly and be aware you cannot move it through the north part where there are struts</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Removing the Lens Cap</h2>
    <p>Remove the plastic bag covering the end of the telescope and the lens cap underneath. You'll need to bring the end of the telescope quite low, but be very careful not to point it below the horizontal.</p>

    <h2>Finding Objects</h2>
    <h3>Using the Computer</h3>
    <p>The program "tcs" should already be running. If not, double-click "Telescope Information Panel" on the desktop.</p>
    <p>Use these commands in the terminal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For deep sky objects and stars:</strong> Type <code>gocat x</code> where x is the object name (use quotes for names with spaces)</li>
        <li><strong>For planets and Moon:</strong> Type <code>planet x</code> where x is the planet name, then type <code>next</code></li>
        <li><strong>For comets and asteroids:</strong> Find the RA and DEC coordinates, then type <code>object x hh mm ss &lt;sign&gt;dd mm ss J2000</code> followed by <code>next</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you've selected your target, move the telescope to about 30 seconds below the right ascension given in "Target" to give time for the object to move into position while you're turning on the motor.</p>

    <h2>Using the Motor Drive</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With the worm disengaged and the 3 hand-wheel clamps unclamped, verify the wheel rotates independently of the polar axis</li>
        <li>Engage the worm with the wheel and allow it to mesh fully</li>
        <li>Switch on power to the controller box by turning the rotary switch clockwise</li>
        <li>Tighten the hand-wheel clamps at the lower edge of the wheel and the clamp at the top edge (the RA display should slow down and stop)</li>
        <li>Use the guiding and setting motions on the hand-paddle (+ and - buttons) to adjust the position</li>
        <li>The large rectangular button (red/yellow) selects sidereal rate (red) or lunar rate (yellow)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Eyepieces and Filters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Never touch the glass surfaces of eyepieces</li>
        <li>Lower focal length eyepieces provide higher magnification</li>
        <li>There are two boxes of eyepieces: ordinary eyepieces in the "Northumberland Dome" box and more modern Meade Pl√∂ssl eyepieces in a separate heated box</li>
        <li>There are 1.25" and 2" eyepieces - to use 2" eyepieces, remove the 2"-to-1.25" adapter</li>
        <li>Eyepieces must be screwed in or they will fall out</li>
        <li>To focus, use the black knobs on the side of the focuser (the larger knob for coarse focusing and smaller knob for fine adjustments)</li>
        <li>A 13% neutral density filter is available for lunar observations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>After Observing</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the motor is switched off and all three clamps and the worm are disengaged</li>
        <li>Ensure the computer monitor is left on</li>
        <li>Replace the lens cap and bag (and finderscope cap if used)</li>
        <li>Make sure the focuser is unlocked, and the extension tube and 40mm eyepiece are in the telescope</li>
        <li>Return all eyepieces to their boxes</li>
        <li>Rotate the dome so the slit is over the door</li>
        <li>Point the telescope away from the slit before closing the dome</li>
        <li>Close the dome and lock the latch</li>
        <li>Return the telescope to a vertical position</li>
        <li>Return the large observing chair to the West</li>
        <li>Return any other equipment used</li>
        <li>Sign out in the Attendance Book</li>
        <li>Turn off the lights</li>
        <li>Turn the alarm back on before exiting (key in the code and exit within 20 seconds)</li>
        <li>Return to Churchill to hand in the key and collect your ObsCard</li>
    </ol>
