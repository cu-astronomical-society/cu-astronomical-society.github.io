            <h3>Talks</h3>
            <p>We invite a variety of people working in astronomy to give talks to the society. The topics are taken from a wide range of areas, from pure astrophysics to the history of astronomy, observing, and much more. Talks are generally about an hour long, including questions to the speaker, and are followed by casual conversation over refreshments. Talks cost Â£2 or are free to members.</p>

            <h3>Obs events</h3>
            <p>ObsNights (weather permitting) are held at the Institute of Astronomy and combine both tips on practical astronomy with observing at the telescopes.</p>
            <p>We also train people to use the telescopes in their own time through Obs demos.</p>
            <p>There is also lots of <a href="/obs/telescopes/">fantastic equipment available</a> for member use.</p>
