    <h1>History</h1>
    
    <p>Founded in 1942, CUAS has a long and interesting history. Throughout the years, many famous astronomers have been associated with our society and indeed many CUAS members have become distinguished astronomers themselves. This website is part of an ongoing project to preserve the large archive of historic material of the society (mostly letters, event descriptions, observation records) and allow current members to enjoy and learn about the CUAS heritage. CUAS has an extensive archive, which is currently stored at the Institute of Astronomy. We are always grateful for further contributions to the archive from CUAS alumni. Some gems from the archive are shown below.</p>
    
    <h2>Notable Speakers</h2>
    <div class="flex">
        <div class="w-3/5 p-4">
            <p>CUAS has been privileged to host many famous astronomers as speakers throughout its history. Sir Fred Hoyle, Sir Arthur Eddington, and Sir Patrick Moore are just a few of the illustrious scientists who have given talks to the society.</p>
            <p>These talks have covered a wide range of topics, from cosmology and stellar evolution to planetary science and the history of astronomy.</p>

            <p>CUAS has a rich tradition of practical astronomy. Throughout its history, members have been trained to use the telescopes at the Institute of Astronomy, particularly the historic Northumberland telescope.</p>
            <p>The society has organized regular observing nights, where members can learn practical astronomy skills and observe celestial objects through the telescopes. These events have been a cornerstone of the society's activities since its founding.</p>

            <p>Not all observing activities were strictly astronomical! Members have found many creative ways to enjoy their time together, including building astronomical snowmen.</p>
            <p>The camaraderie developed during these observing sessions has been a vital part of the CUAS experience throughout its history.</p>
