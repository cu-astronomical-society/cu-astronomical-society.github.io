<h2>Why Neptune?</h2>        

<p>Neptune has a special place in the history of the Northumberland telescope. In 1846, the director of the observatory, James Challis, set out to look for the 8th planet predicted by Adams and LeVerrier – he recorded the planet in his observations but failed to recognise it as such before the German astronomer Galle announced his discovery. Now our magazine bears the planet’s name.</p>
